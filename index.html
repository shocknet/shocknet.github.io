<h1>Welcome to Shock</h1>
<p>Shock is an implentation of encrypted identity and messaging protocols secured by your Bitcoin private keys, integrated into a Lightning wallet. "ShockApp" is a wallet software who's goal is to such features in a social context that is friendly to novice users.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is not only to create a user-friendly Lightning wallet, but to do so in a manner that drives adoption to Bitcoin as a utility in day-to-day interactions.</p>

<h3>Status</h3>
<p><li><b>March 18, 2018</b> - Very exciting news with the release of LND .4, establishing a nice stable base from which to continue lightning implementation. This last week has largely gone to development of the relay daemon and implementing the public/private key messaging into the wallet. Messaging, including encryption and relay, is nearly complete. The front end has begun bringing mockups to life and has made significant progress.</a></li>
</p>
<p><li><b>March 11, 2018</b> - The development team has spent the last several days extensively testing the latest commits of LND as it relates to provisioning of identities, and has moved on to structuring this data. The front-end has begun working through mockups to create the most intuitive experience for creating and managing multiple identities, including incognito identities. Community management has provisioned a Twitter handle that will be the primary means of communicating acute updates. The twitter handle for this account is <a href="https://twitter.com/shock_crypto">@Shock_Crypto</a></li>
</p>
<p><li><b>March 7, 2018</b> - For the last week we have been reviewing the programmatic means to communicate with LND as efficienctly as possible for mobile application. gRPC offers considerable advantages and is in the early stages of testing in JavaScript. Github prescence created.</li>
