<h1>Welcome to Shock</h1>
</p>
<p>We're two guys that love Bitcoin and want to see it grow, so we're building a mobile Lightning Wallet. The vision for this wallet is to serve also as an identity and social platform, complete with a marketplace, making Bitcoin intuitive by resembling the apps people already use. We've hired an excellent UX/UI designer to help us achieve this goal. Other features of Shock include encrypted messaging/ecommerce, an opt-in public directory, trust system, and more. </p>

<h3>Status</h3>

<p><li><b>April, 2018</b> - We've hired a UX/UI designer to make our front-end attractive to the users we hope bring to the Bitcoin fold. We'e prioritized Shock Marketplace functionality for the prototype and are continuing to work toward that release. </li>
</p>
<p><li><b>March, 2018</b> - Progress was rather slow prior to the release of LND .4, following this we now have the majority of core lightning features implemented and have begun to use those with Shock Message signing while building Shock-Specific Features. </li>
</p>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>While working toward the first commit, we will begin to create a community presence from which to draw support for further development. Capitalist_Dog is the acting community manager, and can be emailed at <a href=mailto:Capitalist_Dog@tuta.io>Capitalist_Dog@tuta.io</a>, or messaged via <a href="https://twitter.com/CapitalistDog1">Twitter</a>. You may also find us on Keybase in shocknet.public. </p><p>A prototype commit is expected by the end of May 2018.
